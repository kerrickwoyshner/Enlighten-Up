# API-powered Web App

Enlighten-Up:

Description : Provides a current news article based on a user-based input topic search, and then prompts the topic input to also generates a relevant meme, dad joke, and gif.

Motivation: We live in chaotic times, where we are all constantly bombarded with information: news, social media, opinions, advertisements, etc... . So, we strived to create a news source app that provides relevant relief from the madness.

The user has control and can search for a news article based on a user based input topic and then that search term returns a news article - just an unobtrusive, simple link, which gives the user the option to click on the article or not (and then the article opens in a separate tab, allowing the user to maintain their zen experience). The search term then also generates comedic relief or distraction, in the form of a meme, dad joke, and gif.

The user can also select the "Surprise Me" feature where application returns random headline, and corresponding comic relief based on the headline.

SIMPLY PUT: Get your info and maintain your calm.
